## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in this project, please open up an [issue](https://github.com/jmkoni/course_review/issues).
I will look at these at least once a week. When I see it, I will either tag it as 
[`accepted`](https://github.com/jmkoni/course_review/labels/accepted) or [`wontfix`](https://github.com/jmkoni/course_review/labels/wontfix). 
If it is `accepted`, I will fix it as soon as possible.
